# SzklankApp

---

I've made a tiny app for counting your daily water consumption.

Your past results are shown in a pretty table.

Data is stored in `Local Storage`.

## Available scripts

`npm run start` - runs development mode

`npm run build` - runs build process for production

`npm run publish` - runs build process and publish the page using `gh-pages` branch
